# Laravel XpressWallet SDK

Welcome to the documentation portal. Key links:

* **API Guide (Auto Routes)**: [api-guide.html](./api-guide.html)
* **Repository README**: [GitHub](https://github.com/atanunu/laravel-xpresswallet)

The HTML API Guide documents the optional autoâ€‘registered proxy endpoints (customers, wallets, cards, transfers, merchant, team, transactions). Enable them only after securing with proper auth & rate limiting.

If you expected more pages here you can extend this static site by adding additional markdown or HTML files under the `docs/` directory.
